This is a NextJS project for Enception.AI, the AI influence engine. 

When generating frontend, make sure you do it to maximize the SEO, use server side rendering when possible. When adding a page, remember to add it also to sitemap.xml.

Before adding a new type or interface, please check if there is any types under src/types/*.

Do not add too much comments (only to instruct, don't explain too much).
